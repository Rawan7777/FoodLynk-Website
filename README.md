v1.0:   Start with the website’s core structure (index, login, sign-in, and brand maker) pages,
including their CSS files.

v1.1:   Create the database and add functionality to client_sign_in.php and create_brand.php to check
and insert data, and to client_login.php and brand_login.php to fetch and validate data, while also
improving the CSS.

v1.2:   Update the PHP code and file naming, and add new pages (master_admin_dashboard.php,
brand_waiting.php, and brand_status.php).

v1.3:   Add brand_dashboard.php and its CSS to fetch and insert meals, make the brand name unique in
brand_creation.php, redirect users correctly in brand_login.php and index.php, and include DATABASE.md
for phpMyAdmin queries.

v1.4:   Add a logout button and the unlimited quantity option in brand_dashboard.php, fetch approved
brands and display them in index.php, and update the brand cards’ HTML and CSS.

v1.5:   Add menu.php and menu.css to show the menu of the selected brand, fetch and display meals, and
allow clients to purchase while sending data to the database.

v1.6:   Not much changed here, as I was busy, but now I’m back to continue the project.

v1.7:   Apply a major design and theme update with new colors, animations, renamed HTML elements,
deleted files, and merged files to improve aesthetics.

v1.8:   Enhance brand_dashboard.php card design by adding delete and disable options for meals,
redesign the pop-up form with new options, and upgrade menu.php with sorting, filtering, searching,
improved card design, and a cart for purchased meals. Add client_account.php and client_edit_profile
php with their CSS, and make small database adjustments.

v1.9:   Make the activate button in brand_dashboard.php functional with confirmation pop-ups for it
and the delete button, group ordered meals with details in client_account.php, and improve how
add_to_cart works in menu.php so it remembers the page position. Add checkout.php to review order
info, confirm.php to validate, and success.php to show completion, along with their CSS.
